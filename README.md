# Titan
So, I took the courage to reverse the Very noise official video from Igorrr band and post it here truth, there might be, but you know, and Igorrr band kinda knows and many people might feel it that truth, can be irritating.
let's say there was a life form on Titan, and we could go there NASA can do it for sure, but would you be able to talk with a lifeform that's malformed? dysmorphic, very noise for example? if we could reach Titan this would mean we kinda move all around like crazy electrons, and if a life forms mimics our moves
it would be very awkward...like scary awkward..noise and kinda smelly...so I believe that this idea is what they tried to cover till today. Sad huh? sad but true!
